## Story

AS A USER I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so I have quick access to their information.

## Install

There is no installation required for the user.

Being open-source, if someone wants to dig into the nuts and bolts of this application, simply clone the repo and use the CLI to install the necessary node module packages/dependencies
